The game enters a while loop that continues until either the player runs out of lives or correctly guesses the entire word. Inside the loop, the game displays the current state of the word, the number of remaining lives, and the letters that have been guessed. It then prompts the player to input a letter.

After the player inputs a letter, the code checks if that letter is present in the word. If it is, the corresponding element in the vector that keeps track of the guessed letters is set to 1. If not, the player loses a life. The letter is then added to a vector of guessed letters.

Finally, the code checks if the player has guessed the entire word. If they have, the game ends with a congratulatory message. If they have run out of lives, the game ends with a message telling them what the word was and prompts them to play again.
